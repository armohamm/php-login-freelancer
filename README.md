# Bootstrap php login website

This is the php for the private section of https://scuola.fantasiadanzarovigo.com.

I am [Daniil Gentili](http://daniil.it), and I wrote the code from scratch, using only [this website](http://m.wikihow.com/Create-a-Secure-Login-Script-in-PHP-and-MySQL) to avoid security issues by some easily hackable piece of PHP.

This php login website uses a nicely customized bootstrap theme based on [the freelancer theme](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-freelancer).


You can also use this code as a base for your website, just link to [my website](http://daniil.it).
 
Setup the mysql database using [these instructions](http://m.wikihow.com/Create-a-Secure-Login-Script-in-PHP-and-MySQL),  then customize the code for your needs.


If you found a bug, [fork](https://github.com/danog/php-login-freelancer/fork), edit and submit a pull request.

And do check out [my other projects](https://daniil.it)!
